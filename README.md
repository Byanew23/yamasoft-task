## Design Decisions

I decided to go with a darker theme to make it easier on the eyes and with a clean minimalistic look to make it pleasent to use and easy to read.

I could've implemented Theme switcher (dark/light) but not enough time

Used placeholders for broken images since some of the image links are not available and wanted to keep thing consistent.

The search is optimistic, depending on text position since limited time is available.

Could have used CSS framworks (bootstrap, Tailwind, Styled Components) for ease of use but since this is just a small application for demonstration purpouses decided to keep it simple and lightweight.
